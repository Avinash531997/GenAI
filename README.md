These notebooks are based on Ed Donner's course on Udemy. I have used the code repository provided as part of the course and built upon it to deepen my understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs).

The content here reflects a mix of course material and my own hands-on exploration â€” including modifications, experiments, and extensions beyond the original code.
